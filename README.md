# ESG Quantitative Screening Dashboard

## Automatically Generated by AI

This codebase—including the main Streamlit app, reporting logic, and ESG screening methodology—was generated and iteratively improved with the assistance of advanced AI (OpenAI GPT-4, via Perplexity AI).  
All coding, threshold design, and structure were produced through interactive co-creation between the end user (RIA principal) and AI over a series of directed prompts.

**Disclaimer:**  
- All outputs were reviewed and tested by the end user prior to implementation in compliance workflows.
- Any logic errors or omissions reflect the collaborative, templated nature of AI programming.
- See `/config.py` and `/report_generator.py` for the latest methodology and threshold philosophy.
